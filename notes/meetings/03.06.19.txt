Note about Data-Formatting 2000-2013:

According to Chinmay, there are cases in Data Structure 3 where there is one val flag present in one row and in the adjacent next row, there is no val flag but instead it is blank. Yet both are valid data. 

**************
Chinmay has now resumed working on Air Pollution and has been added to the GitHub Repository.

We can graph things using Kepler.gl , for instance,
graph hourly data averages of "clean" data.

What Nicholas should do for now: 
Use Data-formatting-2000-2013 (the oldest script he made) to narrow down Data_2000.csv in Data Structure 3.
Generate hourly averages using this narrowed data. 
Compare the existing hourly averages to this "new" one and see which is bigger / better. 
Data-Formatting-2000-2013 restricts to only sites which have "VAL" in their flag codes and have all wind data present. 

Also make sure to not drop Latitude and Longitude in the hourly averages. 
Maybe add them back in to the previously generated hrly averages. 
According to Chinmay using Latitude and Longitude will improve results significantly. 

Chinmay plans to do more descriptive statistics on Data Structure 3 for instance:
to identify outliers maybe flag them or delete them
(write your goals here @Chinmay)
