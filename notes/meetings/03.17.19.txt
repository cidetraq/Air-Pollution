Since last time: 

(This documentation not found elsewhere)
Running linear regression and random forest models on generated hourly average data for 2000 that used Chinmays' 71 sites resulted in:
Linear Regression R^2 score: .04
Random Forest, 10 estimators: .42
Random Forest, 1000 estimators: .48

This was after replacing AQS_Code with latitude and longitude in that hourly average data.
